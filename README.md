# M5forecasting
For the course applied forecasting in complex systems a Kaggle competition has been hosted. Part of the M5 dataset has been used. In this course a forecasting model had to be created. A seasonal arima model has been used. The final model was a seasonal arima model per product. A python file was used to clean the data and an R script was used to create the model. 


A python script was used to clean the data and export it to csv. This csv file is also seen in this folder. 
Best model.R was the R script with highest accuracy on kaggle. Besides that there is a script using a neural 
network and dynamic regression with arima errors as seperate scripts. There is also a script which is called the cumulative approach.R 
This is used to generate the images in chapter 5.2.
